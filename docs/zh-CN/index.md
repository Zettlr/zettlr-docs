# Welcome!

This is the official documentation for the Zettlr Markdown Editor. This documentation describes the features Zettlr offers for writing text and organizing your files, as well as customizing your experience. In case you have not yet installed Zettlr, you can do so now by going to [our download page](https://www.zettlr.com/download). Zettlr is currently supported on Windows (7 or newer), macOS (10.11 or newer), and various Linux distributions. Please consult the [setup instructions](install.md) for platform-specific instructions on installing the application on your computer.

## How to Read this Documentation

This documentation is structured with Zettlr's extensive feature set and target group in mind. This means that there are several patterns we follow in this documentation; both simple enumerations of certain features, and also extensive guides for more advanced and complex features.

This documentation is made of a few central categories. If you know exactly what you are looking for, the search bar at the top right is the right starting point for you. Otherwise, you can find the different explanations in these categories:

- The **First Steps** section contains instructions on how to set up everything necessary to start working with Zettlr. It also provides a short "getting started" guide in case you want to see what the app offers.
- A section on **concepts** familiarizes you with a few concepts that form the basis of how Zettlr works. It is recommended to read through these documents carefully, since Markdown editors work differently than, e.g. Microsoft Word, and it will help you avoid common pitfalls.
- The **Core** describes the central writing and file management feature sets of Zettlr: What it can do, how it can do it, and where you can customize it.
- **Academic Tools** focuses on features that are especially useful to – but not only! – students and academics.
- **References** contain simple enumerations on general topics (such as an explanation of all available settings or keyboard shortcuts) which serve as a quick reference for you.
