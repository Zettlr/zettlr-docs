# Keyboard Shortcuts

This page contains a list of all shortcuts available throughout the app.

For remembering them easier, here are some thoughts we've put into assigning the shortcuts. In general, we try to follow these rules, but not all shortcuts follow them.

1. **Common shortcuts**: Some shortcuts are so common that they don't fit into our shortcut system, but everybody will recognise them. One example is the preferences shortcut (`Cmd/Ctrl+,`), another the shortcut to finish editing a footnote (`Shift+Enter`). We try to use as many of these shortcuts as possible to reduce friction.
2. **High-priority shortcuts**: You will be using these shortcuts _a lot_ while using the app. These are generally `Cmd/Ctrl` and one single letter. While naming the shortcuts we try to stick to the English names of the command that it triggers (**N**ew, **R**emove, **F**ind, etc). Sometimes this is not possible (for instance the Distraction Free mode is triggered via `Cmd/Ctrl+J`, because `Cmd/Ctrl+D` is already taken by the editor).
3. **Alternative actions**: We take the semantic meaning of the `Alt` key seriously. Therefore, take a high-priority shortcut, add an `Alt` to it and you normally tend to trigger an alternative action on the same target. Notable exceptions to this are the developer panel (opens with `Cmd/Ctrl+Alt+I`, while `Cmd/Ctrl+I` makes text italic).
4. **Alternative targets**: In case you want to perform the same _action_, but on a different target, try using a `Shift` key. Throughout most of the app, `Shift` commands will change the target from the currently selected file to the currently selected directory. The search also utilises this (`Cmd/Ctrl+F` searches the file, while `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+F` searches the whole directory).

> Actions in the editor that involve the mouse generally require to press `Cmd/Ctrl` while clicking, for instance following links in the editor.

## Textfield related app-wide shortcuts

* `Cmd/Ctrl+C`: Copy
* `Cmd/Ctrl+V`: Paste

## Editor related shortcuts

* `Cmd/Ctrl+Alt+C`: Copy as HTML. If there is a selection, it will be converted to HTML and not copied as plain text. This allows you to paste it, e.g., into word processors.
* `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+C`: (Un-)Comment the given text selection (or add a new HTML comment at cursor position).
* `Cmd/Ctrl+X`: Cut. If the editor has focus, it will cut the selection. If nothing is selected, this will cut **the whole line**, in which the cursor is.

* `Cmd/Ctrl+B`: Make the selection bold or insert new bold formatting characters.
* `Cmd/Ctrl+I`: Make the selection italic or insert new italics formatting characters.

* `Cmd/Ctrl+T`: Make the current line a tasklist item.
* `Cmd/Ctrl+F`: Opens the search popup inside the editor that has currently focus (either the main editor or a Quicklook window).
* `Ctrl+Alt+F` (Windows/Linux) `Cmd+Alt+R` (macOS): Insert a new footnote at the current cursor position.

## Table editor shortcuts

These shortcuts work in each table editor once you enter the edit mode by clicking into the table.

* `Tab`: Move to the next cell. If the last column is active, move to the first cell in the next row. If your cursor was in the last column of the last row, a new row will be added automatically.
* `Shift+Tab`: Move to the previous cell. If your cursor was in the first column, move to the last cell in the previous column.
* `Return`: Move to the same column in the next row. If your cursor was in the last row, a new row will be added automatically.
* `Arrow Up/Arrow Down`: Move to the same column in the previous/next row. No new rows will be added if you are in the first or last row.
* `Arrow Left/Arrow Right`: Move the cursor left/right. If the cursor is at the beginning/end of the cell's contents, move to the previous/next cell.

## Preview related shortcuts

* `Arrow Up`: Open the previous file.
* `Arrow Down`: Open the next file.
* `Cmd/Ctrl+Arrow Up`: Jump to the top of the list.
* `Cmd/Ctrl+Arrow Down`: Jump to the bottom of the list.

## Popup related shortcuts

* `ESC`: If any text field inside the popup has focus, pressing Escape will close the popup.

**In the search popup of the main editor**

* `Return`: While the _search_ textfield is focused, it will select the next occurrence of your search term. While the _replace_ textfield is focused, it will replace the next occurrence of your search term with the replacement text and automatically search for the next occurrence.
* `Alt+Return`: While the _replace_ textfield is focused, this will replace all occurrences of your search term with the replacement text.
