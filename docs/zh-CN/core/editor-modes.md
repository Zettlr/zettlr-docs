# Editor Modes

In the View Menu, Zettlr features several Editor settings that may enhance your writing experience. Have a play and see what works for you!

## Dark Mode

Also commonly known as 'Dark Mode', clicking this option will change the background colour of the Editor to black and the default text colour to white.

## Distraction-Free Mode

The distraction free mode removes visual clutter from the Editor environment. Zettlr opens with the [File Manager sidebar](file-manager.md) on the left side of the screen, showing your Workspaces and Files. If you now click on 'Distraction free' in the View menu, you will notice the sidebar disappear and your text content shift towards the centre of the screen.

In this mode, text on the sentence you're currently typing is highlighted and when you complete the sentence by hitting 'Enter', the completed sentence(s) are dimmed by default. Clicking anywhere on your text, shifts the cursor position and highlights that sentence. You can toggle the dimming of text in Distraction free mode in the Editor section of Preferences using the check box 'Mute non-focused lines in distraction-free mode'.   

By default, Zettlr does not hide the Toolbar in Distraction free mode. For those who prefer a truly distraction free app environment, a simple [Custom CSS fix](https://docs.zettlr.com/en/core/custom-css/#hide-the-toolbar-in-distraction-free) is available.

## Typewriter Mode

In the Standard Editor Mode, the cursor moves down and across the page as you type. Typewriter Mode is an extension of Distraction free mode, in which the cursor position remains at the same horizontal level about midway on the page while the text you've written shifts up the page as you write, simulating the paper feed of a manual typewriter.
