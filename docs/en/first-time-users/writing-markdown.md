# Writing Markdown

Now that you have your workspaces set up and created a file, the next step is to simply start writing.

Zettlr uses Markdown. More specifically, it uses a superset of various standards called “Pandoc Markdown.”

Even if you have never consciously worked with Markdown, you have surely used it already, because it is omnipresent. Look at the following text:

```markdown
# What is Markdown?

Markdown is a **markup language** that can be used to *format* (but not
style!) text documents. It supports every common and some useful syntactic
elements including [links](https://www.zettlr.com), `monospaced text`,
or even more complex elements like blockquotes and lists:

> This is a quotation.

1. List item One
2. A second item
3. Third time's a charm
```

As you will notice, this text is both easy to read — even in its “raw” form — and easy to write. That’s why a lot of the software you use everyday supports it. For example, you can use Markdown in…

* … Discord messages
* … WhatsApp
* … many forums
* … GitHub
* … Slack
* … and more.

To get a quick start to Markdown syntax, we highly recommend the guide from [Learn X in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/markdown/). The guide is available in many languages, and everything you see there is supported in Zettlr. If you want to get used to writing clean and unambiguous Markdown, [view the specifications by CommonMark](https://spec.commonmark.org/current/). Also, there’s a [book on the GitHub flavored Markdown syntax](https://gitbookio.gitbooks.io/markdown/content/).  For those engaged in scholarly writing, the [Pandoc manual's section on its extended Markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown) is worth reading.

## Common Shortcuts for Formatting Text

Most of the time, you don’t have to type out all the formatting characters to make text, say, bold. Zettlr incorporates many common keyboard shortcuts for elements, and some make the process even simpler!

Here is a list of some common shortcuts and how they work in Zettlr:

| Shortcut                                                       | Description                  |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd>                    | Bold                         |
| <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd>                    | Italic                       |
| <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd>                    | Insert link.                  |
| <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd>   | Insert image                 |
| <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>                    | Create task-list             |
| <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>   | Toggle comment               |
| <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>     | Copy with formatting         |
| <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>                    | Paste with formatting        |
| <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>   | Paste as plain               |

There are many more available shortcuts. You can find all in the [corresponding reference page](../reference/keyboard-shortcuts.md).

!!! note

	When we type <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd>, we mean "press the Command-key if you are using a Mac, and the Control-key, if you are using a Windows- or Linux-computer."
