# Standalone Files

Sometimes, you have files that you need but which don't really fit into any of your workspaces. One such example would be a global Todo-list file. Zettlr allows you to open arbitrary files alongside your workspaces.

This approach works similarly to how Word-processors work: You search for a (Markdown) file using your file browser and open it with Zettlr by double-clicking it. (Make sure Zettlr is set as your default app for opening Markdown files.)

When opening arbitrary files directly from within your file browser, Zettlr will first see if the file is part of one of the workspaces that you have loaded. In that case, it will open the file as if you had clicked on the file's entry from within Zettlr.

If the file is not part of any of your loaded workspaces, however, Zettlr will open it as a "standalone" file. If you have standalone files open, it will open a second section on top of the Workspaces section in your file manager titled "Files". Any file that you can see in this section will not be part of any of your workspace.

## Locating Standalone Files on Disk

While Zettlr will simply show you a list of standalone files that you have opened, those files may sit in very different locations across your computer. If you want to see where exactly a file is, you can open it in your file browser (e.g., Windows Explorer or Finder).

To open a file in your file browser, right click it and select "Show file". This will open your file browser and highlight the file so that you know where it actually is.

> The same approach works with any file in Zettlr. You can always right-click them to open them in your file browser.

## Closing and Removing Standalone files

Zettlr will retain standalone files even across restarts. This means, any file you've opened standalone will sit in the file manager so that you can work on the file at a later time. If you want to get rid of them, you'll have to follow a similar procedure as to closing or removing workspaces:

You can either **close** a standalone file or **remove** it. Similarly to workspaces, closing a standalone file will only unload it from Zettlr but leave it where it is, whereas deleting it will also put it in the trash bin of your computer.

To close or remove a standalone file, right-click it and select "Close file" or "Delete file", depending on what you wish to do.
