# Printing and Previewing

As Zettlr is a WYSIWYM ("What You See Is What You Mean") editor, you define the structure of the document, but not how it will look like in the final output.

This means that you should view all your Markdown documents as **source code** that must be "compiled" before it can be presented to a third party. To do so, Zettlr has a powerful exporting engine. But when you simply want to preview how something looks like quickly, or if you need to print something out, you can do so.

## The Print Preview

You can open the print preview for any file by pressing <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>. This will internally export your document to HTML and display the results in a new window. This can be used for a quick preview of your file. Especially when Zettlr doesn't seem to correctly render more complex syntax, this is a good way to see if the exporting engine can make sense of it.

From there, you can also click the print icon to actually print out the HTML file. This can be useful for situations in which it is easier for you to proofread a document in its printed state rather than on screen. The HTML template has special layouts for the needs of printing out a document.
