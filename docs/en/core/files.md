# Files

After you have opened a workspace, you need to add files to it in order to begin writing notes and essays. If you are migrating from a Word-processor such as Microsoft Word or LibreOffice, you will want to import those files first. Head over to our guide on [importing](import.md) to see how to do that.

## Creating Files

Working with files in Zettlr is similar to your file browser. You can create a new file by right-clicking a folder and selecting "New file â€¦". A text field will open that allows you to choose a file name. The file name will already be pre-populated with a string of digits and have the file extension `.md`. At this point, you can choose a more appropriate filename and hit Enter to create the file.

The newly created file will immediately be opened so that you can start working on it.

> You can customize how the filename will be generated by going to the settings &rarr; Advanced &rarr; Pattern for new filenames.

By default, Zettlr will create a Markdown file for you. However, Zettlr can also open a set of different file types that are important when working with the larger ecosystem. You can change the pre-defined filename extension to any of the supported extensions to create many different files:

| File Type       | Description                               | Extension(s)                           |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Markdown        | Regular Markdown files                    | `*.md`, `*.txt`, `*.markdown`, `*.mkd` |
| JSX Markdown    | Markdown files with JSX                   | `*.mdx`                                |
| RMarkdown       | An RMarkdown file                         | `*.Rmd`                                |
| Quarto Markdown | A Quarto Markdown file                    | `*.qmd`                                |
| LaTeX files     | A TeX file, or template                   | `*.tex`                                |
| JSON files      | A JSON data file (e.g., Zotero libraries) | `*.json`                               |
| YAML files      | A YAML data file (e.g., Pandoc profiles)  | `*.yaml`, `*.yml`                      |

> Note that some features of certain file types are not supported, for example, JSX syntax highlighting or executing R-code from within Zettlr.

## Managing Files

After creating files, you may also want to move them around or rename them. Most of these features work very similar to your file browser:

- You can move around files by dragging and dropping them in the file manager
- Rename files by right-clicking them and selecting "Rename file"
- You can delete files by right-clicking them and selecting "Delete file"
- You can drag files out of Zettlr to, e.g., upload them or open them in another program
- You can drag files into an open file within Zettlr to create a link to that file
- You can duplicate a file by right-clicking it and choosing "Duplicate file". The duplicate will then contain the filename with an appended "copy" in the same folder

## File Properties

If you are interested in some metadata on the file, you can right-click it and select "Properties". The properties contain information on when a file was created, when it has been last edited, how many words it contains and how large it is on disk.

Additionally, the file properties allow you to specify a [writing target](writing-targets.md). To set a writing target, simply select the appropriate number of words or characters, and choose whether the target should refer to "words" or "characters". This allows you to flexibly adjust how long a file will need to become depending on whether your editor/teacher defines a word-based or character-based writing target.

> Note that character counts always exclude spaces.
