# Guide: Zettlr as Zettelkasten

![Zettlr as a Zettelkasten](../img/zettlr_zettelkasten.png)

Zettlr can be used as a sophisticated Zettelkasten system implementing a lot of features to organise and structure your files. To begin creating your own Zettelkasten, follow the following steps.

> Using this guide, you can set up Zettlr to be a replacement for apps such as nvALT, zkn, or The Archive.

**Are you new to the concept of a Zettelkasten? Then we recommend you [read our post on how a successful Zettelkasten works](https://www.zettlr.com/post/what-is-a-zettelkasten) and [watch our accompanying video](https://youtu.be/c5Tst3-zcWI)!**

## Step 1: Adjust the settings

The first thing you want to do to create your Zettelkasten is to have a look at your preferences. The following settings convert Zettlr into a supercharged Zettelkasten:

- General tab
    - File information: On
    - File manager mode: Thin mode.
- Spellchecking tab
    - Turn off all dictionaries
- Export tab
    - Turn off the removal of Zettelkasten IDs
    - Turn on "Don't touch internal links"
- Zettelkasten tab
    - This is the most important tab for a Zettelkasten installation, because here you can adjust the settings of how Zettlr interacts with your Zettelkasten. Please refer to the section on the Zettelkasten tab [in the settings chapter ](../reference/settings.md)to learn about these options in detail.

## Step 2: Create a Directory

After you have set up the basic variables that Zettlr uses for its Zettelkasten functionality, it is time to create a directory. It is common to only have one big directory in which you can throw everything and work with this, therefore one root directory should suffice. Then you'll have a huge list of all your files on every application start and can immediately begin to work.

To add a new directory to Zettlr, hit `Cmd/Ctrl+O`, click the first toolbar button or drag the directory from Finder or Explorer onto the app.

## Step 3: Write!

Now you'll be set to use Zettlr as your Zettelkasten management system. Two operations are important in a Zettelkasten:

1. Creating an identifier to a note, so that you can link to it: You can do this by pressing `Cmd/Ctrl+L` while editing any note, which will paste a generated ID to your note.
2. Linking to other notes: Insert the link opening (default: `[[`) while editing to display the auto-complete dropdown, from which you can choose a note to link to.

If you want to dig deeper into how a Zettelkasten should work and what it should look like, consult the immense amount of resources on Zettelk√§sten, available on the web. A good starting point is [Zettelkasten.de](https://www.zettelkasten.de/). The authors have assembled a large list of blog posts on how to supercharge your writing using a Zettelkasten.
