## How to Read this Documentation

This documentation is structured with Zettlr's extensive feature set and target group in mind. This means that there are several patterns we follow in this documentation; both simple enumerations of certain features, and also extensive guides for more advanced and complex features.

This documentation is made of a few central categories. If you know exactly what you are looking for, the search bar at the top right is the right starting point for you. Otherwise, you can find the different explanations in these categories:

- The **Getting Started** section contains instructions on how to set up Zettlr and its associated tools.
- A section on **concepts** familiarizes you with a few concepts that form the basis of how Zettlr works. It is recommended to read through these documents carefully, especially if you are used to working with Microsoft Word, as Zettlr works different in some subtle ways.
- The **Core** describes the central writing and file management feature sets of Zettlr.
- **Academic Tools** focuses on features that are especially – but not only – useful to students and academics.
- **References** contain simple enumerations on general topics (such as an explanation of all available settings or keyboard shortcuts).
