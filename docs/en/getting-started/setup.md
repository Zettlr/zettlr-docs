## Windows

To install Zettlr on Windows, download the app from the [download page](https://www.zettlr.com/download) and double click to open the installer. By default, the installer will request administrative permission during setup to install the app for all users on the computer.

If you do not have administrative privileges on your computer or do not wish to install the app for everyone, you can choose to install it just for the current user. In this case, no privileges are required, but some features may not work as expected.

> We recommend to install Zettlr for all users.

## macOS

To install Zettlr on macOS, download the DMG-file from our [download page](https://www.zettlr.com/download) and mount it by double-clicking it. Then, drag the Zettlr icon into your Applications directory and wait for the application to be copied over.

> You can also install Zettlr with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) by running the following command:
> 
> `$ brew install --cask zettlr`
>
> For more information, visit the [Zettlr Homebrew page](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/zettlr).

## Ubuntu/Debian

To install Zettlr on Ubuntu or Debian derivatives, download the `deb`-package from our [download page](https://www.zettlr.com/download) and execute the file.

## Fedora

To install Zettlr or Fedora or Red Hat derivatives, download the `rpm`-package from our [download page](https://www.zettlr.com/download) and execute the file.

## Arch Linux

Thanks to community efforts, Zettlr is available as a regular package for Arch Linux. To install Zettlr on Arch, follow the normal installation instructions for packages on Arch. Read more on the [Zettlr Arch Wiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Zettlr).

> We never heard any complaints about the Zettlr Arch package and believe it to be trustworthy and safe. However, since we do not control the compilation stage of these packages, we need to add a disclaimer that we cannot take responsibility for them. In case of problems, please get into contact with the maintainers directly.

## AppImage

Zettlr is available as an [AppImage](https://appimage.org/) bundle for Linux. To install it, download the package from our [download page](https://www.zettlr.com/download). To install the AppImage, place the file into a directory of your choosing, make it executable, and being using it.

## Flatpack

Zettlr is available as a [Flatpack](https://flathub.org/home). To install the Flatpack version, download it from [Zettlr's FlatHub page](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.zettlr.Zettlr) and follow the setup instructions.

> The Flatpack cannot access your file system by default. To give it access to your documents, you must first configure that with a package like, for example, [Flatseal](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.tchx84.Flatseal). In case of problems, please get in contact with the Flatpack maintainer on the [corresponding GitHub repository](https://github.com/flathub/com.zettlr.Zettlr). Do not file reports on the main repository â€“ we won't be able to help you.

## Updating Zettlr

The application checks for new updates each time you start the app. You can also manually trigger the search for updates by clicking 'Help' -> 'Check for updates'. If a new version is available, Zettlr will show you a dialog that contains the new version's number, your current version and a changelog with all features and bug fixes the new version contains.

> Never "jump over" versions! Sometimes, we update the configuration of Zettlr during an update. However, we may remove the required code in a later version. This may lead to data corruption during an update. If you haven't updated Zettlr in a while, you should **not** update directly to the latest version, but instead install each update one after another.

To update, click the download button and wait for the download to finish. Then, click "Begin Update", which will close Zettlr and begin the update process. The updater will be placed in your Downloads-folder. You can remove it once the update was successful.

> Do not use this update procedure if you installed Zettlr via a package manager, e.g., Homebrew. In that case, please update according to your package manager's procedure to avoid conflicts. You can also disable the preference "Automatically check for updates" to prevent the update check from occurring within Zettlr.

If automatic updates don't work for you, you can always manually update by downloading the appropriate installer for your system (see above). There is no (technical) difference between the first setup and an update; the files are the same.

> You can opt in to beta releases. To do so, activate the preference "Notify me about beta releases" in the settings.

## Uninstalling Zettlr

If you are unsatisfied with Zettlr or need to remove the app, please follow these instructions.

> Consult your package manager's documentation on uninstalling software if you installed Zettlr with a package manager. Do not follow these instructions in this case.

On **Windows**, go into the software settings and uninstall it according to [Microsoft's instructions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uninstall-or-remove-apps-and-programs-in-windows-4b55f974-2cc6-2d2b-d092-5905080eaf98). If you wish to remove the settings and user data as well, you can find those in the directory `C:\Users\<your-user-name>\AppData\Roaming\Zettlr`.

On **macOS**, head over to the `Applications` folder and move `Zettlr.app` to the trash. If you wish to remove the settings and user data as well, you can find those in the directory `/Users/<your-user-name>/Library/Application Support/Zettlr`.

On **Linux**, the uninstall procedure depends on your distribution and how you installed the app. Please consult the appropriate manual on how to do this. If you wish to remove the settings and user data as well, you can find those in the directory `/home/<your-user-name>/.config/Zettlr`.

## Nightly Releases

Since 2.0.0, we also offer so-called nightly releases. Nightlies are releases that are being built automatically every Monday at noon (UTC) (but sometimes we build them manually). They contain the most recent changes to the code base. This means that they are even more recent than the beta releases, **but** this also means that they may contain serious bugs which we haven't found yet.

Nightly releases are for advanced users only who understand the risks in using these. If you keep your settings, the writing statistics, and your files backed up regularly, it might be safe to use nightlies. We do appreciate every one who uses nightlies and informs us about bugs they encounter.

To install a nightly release, you need to manually download them from <https://nightly.zettlr.com/>. Your updater will not notify you about nightly releases, but since they are being automatically built every week, you can be sure that there will be a new release.

> **Warning**: Nightly releases are fully automated. We do not guarantee any amount of stability for these. Normally, nothing bad should happen, but there is a chance that these releases may damage your computer. By using nightly releases you agree that you understand these risks.

Please also note that we do not retain any previous nightly builds. Each week's nightly will simply replace the previous one. If a nightly is unusable, feel free to notify us so we can manually schedule a new build after we have fixed the bug.
